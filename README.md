**Basic Date Invitation Website**
Overview
This repository contains a basic web application designed to send a date invitation in a fun and interactive way. The site features a simple interface where the user is greeted with a question and can respond with "Yes" or "No". Depending on the response, different elements and options are displayed.

Features
Interactive Buttons: The "No" button moves away when hovered over or clicked, adding a playful element to the interaction.
Dynamic Content Display: Upon clicking "Yes", the user is presented with a choice of activities, each represented with an image. Upon selection, the chosen activity is displayed with a message instructing the user to take a screenshot and send it.

If you encounter any issues or have questions about the functionality of the site:

Understanding the Code: You are encouraged to copy and paste the code into a ChatGPT session and ask for explanations. This can help you grasp how the website functions and what each part of the code does.
Translation of Comments or Instructions: If you need any part of the code comments or instructions translated or explained, ChatGPT can assist you with that as well. Simply paste the specific lines or sections you need help with, and ask for a translation or explanation.
